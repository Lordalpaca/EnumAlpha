# EnumAlpha
My website, EnumAlpha, comes from two words: “Enum” and “Alpha.”
“Alpha” is my name. “Enum” refers to the enumeration class in JavaScript that compiles constants — much like how I compile my creations, myths, and history here. It also draws inspiration from Enuma Elish, the ancient Babylonian myth of the cosmos’s birth.
This is where my story begins — the merging of spirit and technology. *mic drop*
